        <h2>First memories of Wii U</h2>
        <p>My first memories go back a very long time, even before I lived here. Sometimes, my family would visit the neighbor's house next door for some reason I don't recall. I don't say I recall anyone really from the house, but one of the kids that lived there had a Wii U console I know I remember specifically. I remember holding the Wii U gamepad, and knowing it felt so premium, with an entire touch-screen display in the middle of it. I believe the game the kid was playing was some sort of Sonic game, but I can't say I recall very well.<br></p>


        <h2>My experiences with Wii U now</h2>
        <p>
          Now as of writing this, I can actually say that I own a Wii U console. I got it for my birthday in 2023, and it was so amazing to experience the console again after so many years. From what I know, it is one of Nintendo's worst selling consoles of all time, and although I can understand why from all sorts of issues relating to confusion, poor advertising, and few games, I still had a lot of fun when using it. This time I could even properly hold the gamepad in my hands. <br>I have had such amazing experiences so far in using the Wii U, playing games such as Splatoon, Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and plenty more I have not even mentioned.
        </p>

        <h2>TOP FIVE WII U GAMES</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Mario Kart 8</li>
          <li>Super Mario 3D World</li>
          <li>New Super Mario Bros. U</li>
          <li>Super Smash Bros. for Wii U</li>
          <li>Nintendo Land</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>Overall, I do enjoy the Wii U a lot, along with many other people. Unfortunately, it did not get the chance to succeed and many people often forget it as many of it's great games have been ported to the Nintendo Switch, which is a handheld video game console that is also portable. Even with this fact, I still enjoy the Wii U for what it does. I only wish that the idea of there being another screen being on the gamepad worked out better than it did.</p>
