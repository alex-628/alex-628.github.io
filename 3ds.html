        <h2>My first expreiences with Nintendo 3DS</h2>
        <p>The Nintendo 3DS is the first video game console I owned myself, so I remember it extra fondly.<br> <br>
          I remember when I got it for my birthday when I was maybe seven or six years old. I can still remember unboxing it with all of the accessories that came in the box, and also unboxing the charger itself because that wasn't included as part of the console itself. It was the New Nintendo 3DS XL model, which meant it also had a better processor and was faster than the original model.<br> <br>
          I remember playing with the built-in software at first when I got it, like AR games which was a tech demo of what sorts of games could utilize AR features on the console, and Face Raiders, which was an actual game that used AR. I also believe I got two games with the console originally which may have been Mario Kart 7, and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS. I may have gotten a Lego game with it as well, but I don't know how true that is.<br><br>
          I used the console for a very long time and took it with me everywhere. I got many more games some of which I still play today. Unfortunately, not all on the same console though, because at some point around 2020 or 2019, I broke the console into a state where I couldn't even turn it on anymore. I believe I tried troubleshooting my issue by searching the internet, but I couldn't fix it. So unfortunately we had to send it in for repair to Nintendo. Around this time repairs for the console had become difficult, so I was either out of luck, or it would cost too much. <br><br>Unfortunately, they were unable to repair it, but they did offer a replacement to me, which is the one I continue to use today.
        </p>


        <h2>My experiences with Nintendo 3DS now</h2>
        <p>
          I am now using the replacement model, which although may not have any of my old information and be in an entirely different color, I continue to enjoy it today.<br><br> I play mostly the same games, but I've also used it to play some old classic games on the go, as it can play most Nintendo handheld games, and the console games up until the Nintendo 64. I also use it to experience some of the old games that I used to play again, as they continue to be available to me. Finally, I have recently begun to use the console as a music player by adding my music to the SD Card and using the built-in music application and headphones.

        <h2>TOP 3DS FIVE GAMES</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Mario Kart 7</li>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>I love this video game system overall. I have many memories from using it when I was younger, and it continues to satisfy me through the vast experiences it offers me that aren't replicated even on the Nintendo Switch. Along with the fact that the Switch is not backwards compatible with the Nintendo 3DS, I still see myself using it daily as a result.</p>
