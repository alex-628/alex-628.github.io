        <h2>My first expreiences with Nintendo 3DS</h2>
        <p>The Nintendo 3DS is the very first video game consoles I owned myself, so therefore I remember it extra fondly.<br> I remember when I got it for my birthday when I was maybe seven or six years old. I can still remember unboxing it with all of the accesories that came in the box, and also unboxing the charger itself because that wasn't included as part of the console itself. It was the New Nintendo 3DS XL model, which meant it also had a better processor and was faster than the original model.<br> I don't remember what games I had when I got it for my birthday, but I remember playing with the built-in software, like AR games which was a tech demo of what sorts of games could utilize AR features on the console, and Face Raiders, which was an actual game that used AR. I also believe I got two games with the console originally which may have been Mario Kart 7, and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS. I may have gotten a lego game with it as well, but I don't know how true that is.<br></p>
