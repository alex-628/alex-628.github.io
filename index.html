        Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Alexander and for as long as I can remember, I have been interested in computers and seeing how they continue to make our lives so much easier. When I'm not busy at the moment or thinking about computers, I like to play video games. <br>
        I have many memories of video games, as I have been playing them since I was a kid. This website will present my opinion on four video game consoles I have used throughout my life.
