        <h2>My first experiences with Nintendo DS</h2>
        <p>My experiences with the Nintendo DS are more interesting because I didn't own the console when I was younger. Most likely because it was released around 2006. Also because the Nintendo 3DS is backward compatible with the Nintendo DS. This is where the story begins.<br><br>
          When I was still in elementary school and owned my first Nintendo 3DS, I attended a STEM Camp over the summer where we learned stuff about technology, computers, science, and more. One day I remember from the program though was when I and someone else had a Nintendo 3DS console as well. We played some games I believe, but I specifically remember trading games with them. I'm not sure where this idea came from, but I had the genius idea to trade a $40 Pokemon Alpha Saphire game for a Lego Pirates of the Caribbean game for the Nintendo DS. Not even a 3DS game!<br><br>
          I remember being so disappointed that I traded a game that I enjoyed so much, yet I traded it for something so meaningless compared and I never completed it.</p>
